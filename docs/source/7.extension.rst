Extension
--------------

GRIN Extension offers high-level APIs to expand functionality, as well as a 
default implementation using GRIN basic (low-level) APIs. 
Certain GRIN Extension APIs can be overwritten by a more efficient 
implementation from storage.

List Chain
^^^^^^^^^^^

Starting from v0.1, GRIN provides topology lists (i.e., vertex/edge/adjacent list) 
of a single vertex or edge type in property graph to keep the basic APIs in
low-level abstraction. However, in many cases, users need to traverse all the 
vertices in a property graph. Although the user can first iterate all the vertex 
types and then get the vertex list of each vertex type to traverse, this approach 
increases boilerplate code. Thus, we provide a high-level handle ``GRIN_VERTEX_LIST_CHAIN`` 
and related APIs in GRIN extension to handle this case. 

Similar to ``GRIN_VERTEX_LIST_CHAIN``, we also provide ``GRIN_EDGE_LIST_CHAIN``
and ``GRIN_ADJACENT_LIST_CHAIN``. 
As what the name of ``chain`` suggests, GRIN only provides corresponding 
iterators to traverse the list chains, but not array-like access.
